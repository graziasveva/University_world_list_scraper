# University_world_list_scraper

The goal of this crawler is to scrape a website containing a list of all universities in the world (https://www.4icu.org/), obtaining the following information:
<ol>
<li>-url of the review </li>
<li>-abbreviated name of the university (acronym)</li>
<li>-year of foundation </li>
<li>-country rank </li>
<li>-world tank </li>
<li>-city </li>
<li>-region </li>
<li>-state</li>
<li>-kind (public/public state/private) </li>
<li>-name in the original language (main_name) </li>
</ol>
The dataset contains 13'745 different universities spread across 199 states.
The complete dataset is available in my google drive folder at the following address: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RyLbxU88uEwhhxoAPCpMAskAmNu4BzUl/view?usp=sharing
