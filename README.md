# University_world_list_scraper

The goal of this crawler is to scrape a website containing a list of all universities in the world (https://www.4icu.org/), obtaining the following information:
-url of the review
-abbreviated name of the university (acronym)
-year of foundation
-country rank
-world tank
-city
-region
-state
-kind (public/public state/private)
-name in the original language (main_name)
The dataset contains 13'745 different universities spread across 199 states.
The complete dataset is available in my google drive folder at the following address: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RyLbxU88uEwhhxoAPCpMAskAmNu4BzUl/view?usp=sharing
